Tuples are data structures that look a lot like lists. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable (meaning that they cannot be modified once created). This restricts their use because we cannot add, remove, or assign values; however, it gives us an advantage in space and time complexities.

A common tuple use is the swapping of  numbers:

a, b = b, a
Here  is a tuple, and it assigns itself the values of .

Another awesome use of tuples is as keys in a dictionary. In other words, tuples are hashable.
